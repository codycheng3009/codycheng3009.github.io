**How to Start a Problem**

Feet
* footholds are usually not marked so feel free to place them anywhere on the same coloured holds as the problem
* you can also use volumes or even the wall itself as long as you arent using holds from other problems

Hands
* locate the tape that indicates where you place your hands to set yourself in the starting position of the climb. Sometimes both pieces of tape will be aimed at one hold while other times it can be placed on two different ones.
* just like footholds, you can use any hold of the coloured problem that you are sending along with the volumes and wall for some extra support

**How to Finish a Problem**

Usually the tape will be placed at an end hold with some gyms having a "top" sign to indicate where the end handhold(s) are. When finishing a hold, the climb counts when you have clear control over the last handhold. You can't just jump and tap the hold.

**Volumes and Features**

Volumes are big prism shaped pieces on the walls which can be used for any climb. Sometimes they are extremely useful to place your foot on it to get into that optimal body position or assist in your upwards pulling movements.

## Safety

**How to Fall**

If you have the energy, try to down climb and avoid jumping down. However, sometimes this isn't possible due the the difficulty of the difficulty. In these cases, make sure to take a deep squat and roll away to disperse the force and prevent serious injury.

**Look Before You Climb or Fall**

Since climbing gyms can get pretty busy and cramped, make sure you look at your surrundings before you start your climb so that noone will be crossing over the route that you plan on sending. Also, make sure to look at the wall before walking under so that you avoid the risk of getting landed on. Similarly, before you drop and fall, look down to make sure noone is in your close proximity to avoi collision.
