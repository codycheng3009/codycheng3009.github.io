A "dyno" is a term in climbing that refers to a dynamic and powerful movement that requires you to let go of both of your hands to reach a far target hold. This is a common challenge for newer climbers since it requires some coordination and commitment to the move. Don't worry! This page will breakdown the main steps to help you send that tricky dyno.

**Body Positioning** 

Notice the differences in body positioning. Newer climbers tend to be tense and overgrip the holds due to a fear of falling. This is completely normal but do your best to trust your feet! Make sure you watch your foot placement so you have trust that youre standing on a solid foothold. Relax your arms and drop those hips so that you can use that tension to explode out of a jump. Make sure that your toes are on the footholds rather than the arches of your feet so that you can pivot off of them. This is especially important for horisontal dyno's like the one shown above where you are moving both upwards and to the side.

**Technique**

To generate as much force as possible, you'll want to use those strong legs of yours. When you have those hips low, jump as high as you can while also pulling yourself towards the wall with your arms so that you don't jump away from the wall and miss the target hold. Here is the sequencing that you should be doing for a dyno:
1. Arms extended and hips low to build tension 
2. When you feel the tension, drive down through your legs while pulling yourself towards yourself with your arms
3. Catch and hold!


Here's a useless table:

| Five | Six | Four |
| Ten | Eleven | Nine |
| Seven | Eight | Six |
| Two | Three | One |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box.
