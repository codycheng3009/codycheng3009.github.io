# Body Positioning
When climbing, a good rule of thumb to follow is to have opposite limbs in contact with the wall as much as possible to reduce the amount of swinging or "barndoor-ing." It's important to maintain body tension by driving through your feet and engaging your core. Here is an example and a comparison of how you can use foot swapping to improve your efficiency and reduce swinging:

**Pulling Perpendicular to the Hold Direction**

To help with body positioning, it may also be useful to direct your pulling direction and body tension based on the direction of the hold. By pulling in a perpendicular direction, it makes it easier to hold tension without overexertion which is important for longer or more challenging routes.

**Climbing Relaxed and Extended**
One way to greatly improve your endurance and efficiency is to climb with extended arms. While this does not apply to every situation, for most new climbers it can be challenging to trust your feet which causes overgripping of the holds and increased usage of the upper body. Instead, try climbing your routes with as straight arms as possible. 

**Climbing Head On vs Twisting**
The following comparison shows the difference between a tense climber sending moves head onto the wall versus a climber that climbs with extended arms and twisting at the hips to reduce the effort required to traverse up:
