With the rise in popularity of climbing globally, it's cool to know the distribution of climbers across the globe. This data was taken from a spreadsheet looking at 10,927 climbers and their respective countries of origin.

With the exclusion of many other countries, this data set has its limitations. This data only shows the relative distribution according to the relative locality of the participant entries. 

**Height vs Weight**

With climbers often debating the benefits of being short or tall, there has been no clear evidence that suggests that one side is correct. Given the prevalence of varying heights when analyzing the competitors in international competition, both sides have their advantages. This data showcases the wide variety of max grades and the associated heights of the climbers which does not show any correlation between height and performance.
