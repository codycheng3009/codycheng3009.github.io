# Foot Techniques

When it comes to climbing, foot placement and using your lower body is one of the most important things you should learn. With this simple guide, you will be provided with the necessities to send your climbs with finesse! Before we dive into the specific techniques, there are a few key points to keep in mind first. 

**Foot Placement & Trusting your Feet**

New climbers often have a fear of falling which leads them to pull too much with their upper body and tires them out quicker before they can send a problem. To make things more efficient, be sure to place your feet properly so that you can take most of the weight off of your arms so you can climb for longer! Here are some tips to ensure proper foot placement:

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;"><iframe src="https://www.dartfish.tv/Embed?CR=p191109c538461m7988269&VW=100%&VH=100%&sh=li&aid=accd8f56-2bc5-4737-8a9e-8693ca6b194f" style="position:absolute;display:block;width:100%;height:100%;max-width:100%;max-height:100%;left:0;right:0;top:0;bottom:0;margin:auto;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe></div>

Notice how on the left video the side of the foot is placed on the foothold. This prevents you from being able to pivot off of the foot and make it very difficult to stand up higher on your toes which is important for those farther holds. The video on the right shows proper foot placement with the toes placed in the middle of the foothold allowing for pivoting and reaching. 


**Watching Your Feet**

Whenever you're climbing, make sure to watch your feet go onto the foothold before looking up and moving your hands. This builds confidence in your feet since you know where you're standing. It will help ease the tension and help you offload your hands more to use your legs. 

## Foot Swapping
This is an important skill to learn so you can move across the wall to get to distant holds. Sometimes you will need to get your opposite foot onto the same hold which can be challenging. Here are a few different ways you can use to help:

**Leaving Space**

For those bigger footholds, you can simply place your one foot over to the side leaving room for your other foot to be placed on the empty area. 

**Toe On Toe Swap**

When you don't have enough room to simple place both feet on the foothold, this is a nice method to switch feet. Place one fot directly overtop of the other and slide the bottm foot out. This should make your top foot fall into the desired position. 

**Jump Swap**

</video>
This one is for the flashier and more confident climbers. You simple align your foot overtop of the other and make a small hop to switch out one foot for another. 

## Standing on Volumes
Volumes are big prism features that are allowed to be used in any route. They are typically used as footholds to challenge a climbers balance and technique. These types of problems are called "slabs." Here's how you can stand on volumes more effectively:

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;"><iframe src="https://www.dartfish.tv/Embed?CR=p191109c538461m7989900&VW=100%&VH=100%&sh=li&aid=accd8f56-2bc5-4737-8a9e-8693ca6b194f" style="position:absolute;display:block;width:100%;height:100%;max-width:100%;max-height:100%;left:0;right:0;top:0;bottom:0;margin:auto;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe></div>

Notice how the left video shows a hesitant climber who is a afraid of slipping on the angled volume. As a result, less contact is made and the chances of slippin are much higher. In the right video, the heel is pressed down so that maximum shoe rubber contact can be made with the volume. This creates much more friction and stability, making it very easy to stand comfortably on the volume.

# Body Positioning
When climbing, a good rule of thumb to follow is to have opposite limbs in contact with the wall as much as possible to reduce the amount of swinging or "barndoor-ing." It's important to maintain body tension by driving through your feet and engaging your core. Here is an example and a comparison of how you can use foot swapping to improve your efficiency and reduce swinging:

**Pulling Perpendicular to the Hold Direction**
<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;"><iframe src="https://www.dartfish.tv/Embed?CR=p191109c538461m7989910&VW=100%&VH=100%&sh=li&aid=accd8f56-2bc5-4737-8a9e-8693ca6b194f" style="position:absolute;display:block;width:100%;height:100%;max-width:100%;max-height:100%;left:0;right:0;top:0;bottom:0;margin:auto;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe></div>

To help with body positioning, it may also be useful to direct your pulling direction and body tension based on the direction of the hold. By pulling in a perpendicular direction, it makes it easier to hold tension without overexertion which is important for longer or more challenging routes.

**Climbing Relaxed and Extended**
One way to greatly improve your endurance and efficiency is to climb with extended arms. While this does not apply to every situation, for most new climbers it can be challenging to trust your feet which causes overgripping of the holds and increased usage of the upper body. Instead, try climbing your routes with as straight arms as possible. 

**Climbing Head On vs Twisting**
The following comparison shows the difference between a tense climber sending moves head onto the wall versus a climber that climbs with extended arms and twisting at the hips to reduce the effort required to traverse up:
