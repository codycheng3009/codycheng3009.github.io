When it comes to climbing, foot placement and using your lower body is one of the most important things you should learn. With this simple guide, you will be provided with the necessities to send your climbs with finesse! Before we dive into the specific techniques, there are a few key points to keep in mind first. 

**Foot Placement & Trusting your Feet**

New climbers often have a fear of falling which leads them to pull too much with their upper body and tires them out quicker before they can send a problem. To make things more efficient, be sure to place your feet properly so that you can take most of the weight off of your arms so you can climb for longer! Here are some tips to ensure proper foot placement:

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding:56.25% 0 0 0;"><iframe src="https://www.dartfish.tv/Embed?CR=p191109c538461m7988269&VW=100%&VH=100%&sh=li&aid=accd8f56-2bc5-4737-8a9e-8693ca6b194f" style="position:absolute;display:block;width:100%;height:100%;max-width:100%;max-height:100%;left:0;right:0;top:0;bottom:0;margin:auto;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe></div>

Notice how on the left video the side of the foot is placed on the foothold. This prevents you from being able to pivot off of the foot and make it very difficult to stand up higher on your toes which is important for those farther holds. The video on the right shows proper foot placement with the toes placed in the middle of the foothold allowing for pivoting and reaching. 


**Watching Your Feet**

Whenever you're climbing, make sure to watch your feet go onto the foothold before looking up and moving your hands. This builds confidence in your feet since you know where you're standing. It will help ease the tension and help you offload your hands more to use your legs. 

## Foot Swapping
This is an important skill to learn so you can move across the wall to get to distant holds. Sometimes you will need to get your opposite foot onto the same hold which can be challenging. Here are a few different ways you can use to help:

**Leaving Space**

For those bigger footholds, you can simply place your one foot over to the side leaving room for your other foot to be placed on the empty area. 

**Toe On Toe Swap**

When you don't have enough room to simple place both feet on the foothold, this is a nice method to switch feet. Place one fot directly overtop of the other and slide the bottm foot out. This should make your top foot fall into the desired position. 

**Jump Swap**

This one is for the flashier and more confident climbers. You simple align your foot overtop of the other and make a small hop to switch out one foot for another.
