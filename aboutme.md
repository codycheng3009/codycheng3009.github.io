My name is Cody Cheng and I've fallen in love with the sport of climbing and if you're here I guess you have as well! Hopefully this guide will equip you with the basic skills for your first few grades of climbs!

With the few months that I have been climbing, I've had the chance to climb with a wide range of body types and seen may styles of climbing. Through my own successes and failure, I did my best to make things as easy to understand while providing some useful videos and analysis for you:)
